PURPOSE     RedundancyHeatMapper produces a heat map from a distance matrix with values of 
            lambda obtained using SatuRation (https://github.com/lsjermiin/SatuRation.v1.0).
            
            Lambda is a measure of the degree of saturation across the sites in a pair of
            sequences. The lower a lambda value is, the lighter the corresponding pixel in
            the heat map is.

            Emphasis is on lambda values between 0.0 and 0.3, allowing the sequence pairs
            that are most similar to one another to be identified.
            
FORMAT      Lambda values must be saved in a text file with comma-separated values (.csv).

            The first line must contain the number of samples being compared. 

            Each of the following lines must start with a sample name, and then followed
            by the lambda values, one for each comparison involving the named sample.
 
EXAMPLE     See file labelled 0_Recombination_lambda.csv.

INSTALL     Copy RedundancyHeatMapper.pl to /usr/local/bin/ for easy use. Use this command:

            sudo cp RedundancyHeatMapper.pl /usr/local/bin/. 

EXECUTE     RedundancyHeatMapper -i <infile.csv> <-t|f>

HELP        -t = triangular heat map; -f = square heat map

STATUS      Software complete
